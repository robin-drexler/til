When editing a more complicated command in the terminal, you can open and edit it in your favourite editor on the fly. Helpful, because e.g. vim is far more powerful than `readline`.

To switch to the editor hit `CTRL+x->e`, wile writing a command in your terminal.

Example:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/ctrlxe.gif)
